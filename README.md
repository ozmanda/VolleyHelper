# VolleyHelper
Automated analysis of volleyball game and training data. Fun project :)
**Main objectives:** identify touches and touch types, which then allows to analyse plays, individuals and the team as a whole. By identifying touches, video material can be reduced to relevant moments and categorised. 

There are three use-cases for VolleyHelper: 
1. **After Training:** provides freeze frames and clips of touches. In a further step, analysis of body positioning could help indicate errors in technique.
2. 2.**During Games:** provides real-time statistics on strengths and weaknesses of the opposing team, including tendencies of individual players. In a further step, strategies and plays could be suggested based on the statistical evaluation.
3. **After Games:** provides a statistical overview of the game and the individual players. Deliver freeze frames and clips of touches with categorisation.
