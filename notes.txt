## Input:
- Video with 30 fps for 1.5h
    - 30fps x 60s x 60min x 1.5 = 162'000 frames to analyze
    - Depending on compression (bitsize), it varies between ~1GB and ~ 20GB

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Processing

    ## All-encompassing / permanently
    - Identify active players, track their coordinates
    - Identify ball, track its coordinates
    - Identify PointStart (Service), PointOngoing, PointLost/PointMade
    (basically "play-time" and "no-play-time")
    - cut away "no-play-time"
    - Identify PointEndCoordinates (own field, enemy field, outside field)
    - Identify Player-Ball interaction (contact)
    - Track score (imply pressure/stress level, duration, start/mid/end of set/game)

    ## Statistics / in retrospect
        ## Player-Statistics
            ## Service
            - Service-PointMade
            - Service-PointLost
            - Service-PointOngoing
            ## Attack
            - Attack-Positioning
            - Attack-Direction
            - Attack-Speed (spike or loop)
            - Extract +/- 3sec for review
            - distinguish between
                - Attack-PointMade
                - Attack-PointLost
                - Attack-PointOngoing
            ## Defence
            - Defence-Positioning (filtered, depending on enemy attacking Statistics)
            - Soutien-Positioning
            - Extract +/- 3sec for review
            - distinguish between
                - Defence-PointSaved
                - Defence-PointLost

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
